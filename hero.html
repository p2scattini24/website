<p> This is Min Yoongi. He is part of a band I love. They debuted in 2013 and celebrated their 7th year together last year. I discovered them in 2015 and have stuck with them ever since. I relate to Yoongi the most. On stage he is known as Suga, ans when he releases new music it's under the name of Agust D.</p>
